            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p> Our department is dedicated to providing high-quality education, conducting cutting-edge research, and fostering innovation in the field of computer science.</p>
            Computer science is the foundation of the information technology era that we currently reside in. Therefore, if society is to achieve quick economic advancements and fully benefit from information technology, computer science education is essential. 
            <p>The study and creation of programs that enable us to use computers on a daily basis, the software systems that underpin these applications, and the techniques and procedures employed to create applications and systems that function dependably, accurately, and morally are all included in computer science. 
            The ability to program computers is at the core of computer science, and companies hiring computer scientists look for skilled programmers who understand current methods and tools and can apply good engineering principles to the creation, building, and upkeep of computer programs.
             </p>
